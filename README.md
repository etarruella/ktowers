# KTowers

KTowers is a Minecraft plugin based on the Bukkit API that introduces a strategic team-based minigame. In KTowers, two teams compete to capture each other's tower while defending their own. Players also battle to control resource-generating towers located in the center of the battlefield. The game supports multiple gameplay modes, offering both casual and competitive experiences. 

> [!NOTE]
> KTowers is inspired by an existing minigame called TheTowers, and this plugin automates its functionality, streamlining gameplay and enhancing the overall experience for players. With KTowers, the complexities of managing game mechanics are simplified, allowing players to focus on strategy and teamwork.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plugin is currently under development and does not yet have a stable version available for public use.
